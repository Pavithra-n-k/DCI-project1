        You can use store-bought beef stock, vegetable stock or even water if you don't have two days to make the soup. It won't be as flavorful, but it will still be delicious. The borshch tastes better the next day</p>

        <h1>RECIPE</h1>
        <p>While borshch is made in many countries in Eastern Europe, it is widely considered to have its roots in Ukraine, where many varieties, including a white one, are made. This recipe makes a generous amount, and because it takes some time to prepare, we recommend you freeze portions for whenever you need a hearty meal. The recipe is easily halved, if you prefer.

        In “Please to the Table,” authors Anya von Bremzen and John Welchman write that a “proper” Ukrainian borshch “should include pork or ham and other meats – the more, the better.” And in “Mamushka,” author Olia Hercules says the onion-and-carrot aromatic base “is a distinctively Ukrainian soffritto technique called smazhennya or zazharka.”        
        </p>    

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>
<strong>Step 1</strong> 
Make the stock: In a large soup pot (at least 10 quarts, see NOTES), combine the beef chuck, ham bone and marrow bones with the water — if the water doesn't cover the meat, add more as needed — and bring to a boil over high heat. As the liquid comes to a simmer, it will start to produce gray scum that will float to the top; skim it periodically.
<br>
<strong>Step 2</strong>
Once the liquid comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low so the broth is at a gentle simmer. Add the onion, parsnips, if using, carrot, celery and bouquet garni, then partially cover and cook until the meat is tender and the stock is flavorful, 2 to 3 hours. Remove from the heat, discard the solids (or save for another use), then let cool for about 1 hour and refrigerate overnight.
<br>
Step 3
Make the borshch: The next day, skim off the fat from the stock (it should be a generous layer) and discard or save for another use. You should have about 3 quarts of stock. Add the water and the short ribs, set the pot over medium-high heat, and bring to a simmer.
<br>
Step 4
Reduce the heat to low and add the beets and potatoes. Season to taste with salt and pepper — you want a flavorful but not aggressively seasoned stock — and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.
<br>
Step 5
Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the onions and carrots, and cook, stirring, until the carrots soften and start to caramelize, 5 to 7 minutes.
